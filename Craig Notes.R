### Procclhlorocoocous has chl a... not in this study... mostly offshore and tropical
### synnecocochous also has chl a and phycoarithrym and is bigger than proc and is abundant coastally... bacteria 
## auto pico eukaryotes... not P or S and have chlorophyll... any other phytoplankton... probably not bacteria... mostly phytoplankton.. maybe 3-5 dominat species
# heterotophic bacteria are a lot more 

## Look up Karen Self.. FCM wizard

## FCM will not capture big and/or rare phytoplankton

## phyto generation times 
## heterotrophic baterica are mostly small and slow growing with generation times on the order of days.. probably being eaten... but this is a lot of genera
## heterotrophic bacteria are thousands of different species. So some of these may have short generation times... but bigger ones probably slow growin6
# oligio trophs grow slow... copitrophs are more R selected species.  Have big genomes and ramp up generation times to hours.. If the H bac went up it might be copiotrophic and growing fast in response to the pulse of nutrients
## if they don't change it could be the oligiotrophs that have slow generation times
# Pico auto... look up generation times to see how fast they grow... in the lab they have generation times on the order of hours
## when upwelling is occuring the phytoplankton are often primed to double really fast

## maybe go back to the FCM 

## Synnecocochus could divide at certain times of the day more than at night

# Find a review article in nature microbiology or New phytology on current understanding of physio of synnenocochus, etc... does it use ammonium or nitrate etc.

## upwelling primes the system.. so july and august may be different because of how the system was primed
## show histograms of nutrients and temperature to show july vs august to say if it was or wasnt upwelling

### what do mussels eat??? And how fast do they consume it??? Think about the rate at which they eat to think of rate of removal versus production.

## In H Back rate... the grazing by mussels outweighs grazing in surfgrass pools so thats why the rates are lower 
## always think there is both grazing and growth happening at the same time


# G. Yahel... isreali scientist that has worked on filter feeders like sponges and tunicates and has super detailed numbers on how fast certain critters consume bacteria

## different invertebrates are picky about the size of cells that they eat.  What is the size range of cells that mussels eat.
### with fDOM look at the rate of removal with each components. Keep the fDOM separate initially and pool if there are similar patterns
## can go a long way with the fluxes of fDOM... think about a community uptake 

### consumption and production of microbes and organic patterns in tide pools... think about the removals too... 
### Maybe think about dropping day vs night
## write for ecology letters maybe
### think about mussels as a massive grazer
## H Bac love eating diatom exudates

## can also focus on just one species... for example, with and without mussels... there is a massive diatom bloom (check this in the pico auto data)
## focusing on flux.... this is the gold.. It is "net" removal or addition of cells

### Most interested in the removal vs control pools and maybe upwelling ideas... 
## producer vs consumer-dominated pools... differs with and without the benthic dominant organism
## look at regressions of fluxes change.. ... this could be compelling.. nutrient fluxes vs microbe count fluxes
### maybe leave out the day and night
